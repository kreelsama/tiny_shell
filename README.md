# tiny_shell
A functional shell just for fun and practicing.

The development is in schedule.

# Expected functionalities

* A shell which operates like normal shell without the embedded language (Bash without bash).
* Move cursors in the current input line and use slashes to indicate a newline to complete the command.
* Use hot keys like Ctrl+A/E to place cursors, Ctrl+Shifft+C/V to copy and paste.
* Input/Output redirect using "<", ">", "&", "|" symbols. 
* Pass signals to the running programs with Ctrl+C and etc.
* History supports.
* Subcommand wrappers ('$()') and escape characters ('\\')
